In the past few years Nashville has seen rapid expansion in many other industries. Many people compare Nashville, TN to Austiin, TX. Both cities are upcoming large southern metropolis, who also both claim their large music scenes. I want to use the data science methodology to try to prove its claim to fame on the world stage. If Nashville is able to say it is the definitive Music City of the United States, it will increase its reputation on the map even further bringing more tourist, more business, and more people to the city I call home.
